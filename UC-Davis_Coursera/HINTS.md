# Hints on the **GIS Specialization** from *UC Davis*

Here are my observations on where the directions didn't match reality due to
typos, software updates, etc. I'm working with **ArcGIS Pro v. 3.2.1** in 
January 2024.

On the off chance you are looking for quiz answers or anything else to help you
cheat, you'll need to look elsewhere.

## License

The first challenge I ran into with the course was accessing the license for
ArcGIS Pro. Judging from the course forums, I wasn't the only person confused.

When you register for the GIS Specialization and request a license, you will
(probably) receive an email from a *noreply* address with the subject *License 
Request Received*. One day after that I received a follow up email from 
*notifications@arcgis.com* with the subject *An Invitation to join an ArcGIS 
Online organization, UC Davis Continuing and Professional Education*.

Here's the thing: nothing in that organizational invite suggests that it also 
contains your ArcGIS license, but it does! After emailing 
[coursera@ucdavis.edu](mailto:coursera@ucdavis.edu), the friendly folks at UC 
Davis sent me a PDF with instructions on how to activate the license.

The **TL/DR** is: use the link in the invite email to create an account; then 
navigate to `My settings` > `Licenses` and scroll down to `Download ArcGIS Pro`.
You don't actually enter a license key; that seems to all get handled on the 
back end. You just need to authenticate once when you first load ArcGIS and it 
magically knows you have a license until December 31 of whatever year you 
activated it.
